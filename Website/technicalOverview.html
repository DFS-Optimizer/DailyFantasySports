		<h2> Technical Features:</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<h3>Database</h3>
			<p>We will need a database that can store all of the player and game stats
			for each sport.This will be where we gather all of our data to train and
			run our model. The database will have to auto-update daily in order to
			input ant new stats. We will be using an SQL server for this.</p>

			<h3>APIs and Plugins</h3>
			<p>We will be using an API to interact with the NBA, NFL, and MLB stats.
			Each API will give us access to all recorded stats for each respective
			sport and this will help us in creating our database.

			We will also be suing a plugin to help us with the modeling process as
			well as the optimization. </p>

			<h3>Modeling Process</h3>
			<p>We will be running a linear regression in order to predict the fantasy
			points for each player. We can track the accuracy by looking at the
			P-value. We cant to get as close to 1 as possible although it would be
			phenomenal if we can achieve a P-value of 0.6. Our initial goal will be to
			get above 0.45. We can also check how coherent and useful our data is
			using the Adjusted R squared value. </p>
