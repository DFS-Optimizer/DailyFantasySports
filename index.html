<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
	<p>   This project is intended to assist daily fantasy sports users create an
	optimized lineup for competitions. Making lineups on apps such as FanDuel and
	DraftKings is very difficult because the user is left to create a lineup on their
	own using very limited statistics.</p>

	<p>    With our app, users can automatically generate an optimal lineup based on
	detailed player statistics, player salary, and the salary cap. The user would
	also be able to edit that lineup to suit their preferences. </p>

<h2>Project Goals:</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>Optimized Lineup</h3>
<p>We want to generate an optimized lineup for each user that they can then use on
daily fantasy sports sites. In order to make these lineups, we will use
statistics including: player average points per game, player average performace
against opponent, injury status, strength of the opponent, etc. See our
"Technical Overview" for more information on our statistics </p>

<h3>User-Friendliness and Ease of Use</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create an application that is easy to use and also appealing
in order to keep users happy. </p>

<h3>Daily Fantasy Sports Offered</h3>
<p> We have an initial goal of offering optimized lineups for NBA daily fantasy
sports. After completing this goal to a reasonable degree, we hope to then expand
to other sports such as NFL and MLB.</p>
