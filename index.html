<h1>Daily Fantasy Sports Optimizer:</h1>
<p>
	A project by: Charity Brown, Andy Johnson, Elizabeth Payne, and Gage
	Wassweiler
</p>

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<p>
	     This project is intended to assist daily fantasy sports users create an
	optimized lineup for competitions. Making lineups on apps such as FanDuel and
	DraftKings is very difficult because the only statistic shown to  users is the
	players' average points per game. The user is left to create a lineup on their
	own.
	     With our app, users can automatically generate an optimal lineup based on
	detailed player statistics, player salary, and the salary cap.
